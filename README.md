## Assignment 4: Explore-Sensors

● Collect sensor data from the following sensors: 
    a) accelerometer, b) linear-acceleration,
    c) temperature, d) light,
    e) GPS, and f) proximity.
    
● Collect these data and store into a database using Room. Use separate tables for each
sensor. The UI has a toggle switch for each of the sensors to start and stop collecting
data any number of times.

● The UI also has provisions (buttons) to get the past 1 hour average value of the
accelerometer (for all three axis separately) and temperature sensor.

● If the user wants to see the average values, it should be showcased as part of the UI
using a text view.

● Now using only the accelerometer sensor data identify if the device is stationary or in
motion. Hint: look for patterns in the accelerometer data to determine whether stationary/
in motion.
 ## Rubric:
1. Access to individual sensors i.e. ability to read/write data from the individual sensor is:
Accelerometer (0.5 mark)
Linear Acceleration (0.5 mark)
Temperature (0.5 mark)
Light (0.5 mark)
GPS (0.5 marks)
Proximity (0.5 mark)
2. Store data in database: 3 marks
3. Show the average value for accelerometer (2) and for temperature (1)
4. Motion detection: 3 marks
